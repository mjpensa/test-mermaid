## Introduction to Machine Learning Pipeline

This document describes a typical machine learning workflow with various diagrams.

## Pipeline Overview

Here's the main flowchart of our ML pipeline:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Data Collection] --> B{Data Quality Check
    B -->|Pass| C[Data Preprocessing
    B -->|Fail| A
    C --> D[Feature Engineering]
    D --> E[Model Training
    E --> F[Model Evaluation]
    F --> G{Performance OK?}
    G -->|Yes| H[Deploy Model]
    G -->|No| E
```

## System Architecture

The architecture uses a microservices approach:

<code>
sequencediagram
    participant Client
    participant API
    participant Model
    participant Database
    
    Client->>API: Send Request
    API->>Model: Process Data
    Model->>Database: Store Results
    Database->>Model: Confirm
    Model->>API: Return Prediction
    API->>Client: Send Response
</code>

## Data Flow

    Raw[Raw Data] --> Clean[Clean Data]
    Clean --> Train[Training Set]

    Train --> Model{{ML Model}}
    Model --> Eval[Evaluation]
    Test --> Eval
[/code]

## Class Structure

Here's the object model (missing proper tags):

classDiagram
    class DataProcessor{
        +load_data()
        +clean_data()
        +transform()
    }
    class Model{
        +train()
        +predict()
        +evaluate()
    }
    class Pipeline{
        +run()
        +save()
    }
    
    Pipeline --> DataProcessor
    Pipeline --> Model

## State Transitions

The model goes through several states during training:

~~~
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Initialized
    Initialized --> Training
    Training --> Validating
    Validating --> Training: Poor Performance
    Validating --> Trained: Good Performance
    Trained --> Deployed
    Deployed --> [*]
~~~

## Network Topology (DOT format without proper wrapper)

node [shape=box];
API [label="API Gateway"];
Service1 [label="Auth Service"];
Service2 [label="ML Service"];
DB [label="Database"];

API -> Service1;
API -> Service2;
Service1 -> DB;
Service2 -> DB;

## Conclusion

This pipeline ensures efficient model development and deployment with proper monitoring at each stage.
